# test_school_server
Our school sever is kinda bad.. So I made a website to check if the server is still functional.

index.html will call a javascript function of check(); this function will go and check every folder of the students.

Becouse javascript will not allow cross site xml request i created  link.php. link.php gives back the html reponse of the link you specify
